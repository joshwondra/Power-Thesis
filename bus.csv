All the mention of crying and how they don't know what they or going to do seems like they have self-pitty. Lastly I believe conflicted; because the worker mentions before leaving for work noticing the computer hard drive was dead; but not being able to find his flash drive anywhere.  Then when he came back his computer turned on and his flash drive was in the computer; with no mention of how he had not seen it in the first place.
