3/24/15 14:09,3/24/15 14:56,231,231-1,1,1,Brooklyn,Confliction,Understanding,Doubt,I feel conflicted.  I believe in school; we are strictly taught to adhere to no extensions for late assignments and in some cases a teacher would not expect a power outage as an excuse.  However me personally; understand that things happen and sometimes outcomes can not be predicted or controlled so I understand the position the worker is in and would be obliged to give them more time.  However I say I have doubt as to if the story is the complete truth; because; in the e-mail he/she mentions how sad she is and how the problem occurred but nothing about how he/she would solve it.  Perhaps he or she just does not want to do it.,1,4,1,4,3,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,1,sadness,self-pitty,unsure,The worker talks a ton about how he or she is crying and how awful he or she feels showing sadness.  All the mention of crying and how they don't know what they or going to do seems like they have self-pitty. Lastly I believe conflicted; because the worker mentions before leaving for work noticing the computer hard drive was dead; but not being able to find his flash drive anywhere.  Then when he came back his computer turned on and his flash drive was in the computer; with no mention of how he had not seen it in the first place.  To me this seems odd.,1,1,3,4,2,NA,2,4,1,2,1,2,1,1,1,3,4,2,2,1,3,3,1,4,1,1,4,1,1,2,4,5,1,1,4,4,1,3,2,2,1,2,19,19,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,,7,3,no comment,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The email also makes me question his abilities as an employer and coworker. Not only does it sound like he is going behind Lewis's back (without having even approached him about his concerns yet) to turn him into the boss; but it also seems like Sam is a little kid whining about a problem because he can't deal with it.

How is it that all these things happen at once? Even though I am unaware of who Sam is; I feel that he/she must be disorganized/clustered or not well suited for high stress situations.  For all of  these things to happen at one time is pretty tragic and that leads me to believe Sam either has a very very difficult life or she is lying.
