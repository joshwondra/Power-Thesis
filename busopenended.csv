I'm intrigued/frustrated for a few reasons. For one; it all seems very coincidental and I am a little suspicious about the whole chain of events. A lot of things just happened to go wrong. I am frustrated because it sets the company back and that means it could hurt everyone involved and decrease efficiency. I'm motivated because I want to rectify this situation for the company and Sam. Through some hard work we can turn the situation around and produce a stellar project.

I believe in school; we are strictly taught to adhere to no extensions for late assignments and in some cases a teacher would not expect a power outage as an excuse.  However me personally; understand that things happen and sometimes outcomes can not be predicted or controlled so I understand the position the worker is in and would be obliged to give them more time.  However I say I have doubt as to if the story is the complete truth; because; in the e-mail he/she mentions how sad she is and how the problem occurred but nothing about how he/she would solve it.  Perhaps he or she just does not want to do it.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sadness,self-pitty,unsure,The worker talks a ton about how he or she is crying and how awful he or she feels showing sadness.  All the mention of crying and how they don't know what they or going to do seems like they have self-pitty. Lastly I believe conflicted; because the worker mentions before leaving for work noticing the computer hard drive was dead; but not being able to find his flash drive anywhere.  Then when he came back his computer turned on and his flash drive was in the computer; with no mention of how he had not seen it in the first place.

The frustration comes from the fact that Sam put in a lot of effort in the project and it now has gone to waste in his opinion. I also believe that Sam was stressed out; as he now needs to redo all the work as quickly as he can as it is due in two days. / ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0303,303-1,1,1,Bianca,21,19,1,0,0,0,1,0,,0,0,0,7,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Empathy,Sadness,Anxious,I feel empathy and sadness for Sam because it seems as though he/she is having really rough day.

have been in a similar situation before; and can empathize with how frustrating and scary an experience like that is. Secondly; I ma nervous about both how Sam is going to handle the situation and whether he will be able to grow and learn from this experience or whether it will significantly affect his emotional well being and ability to perform in the workplace. Finally; I am determined to make sure we move forward and handle the situation the best way we can; which will include an efficient search for Sam's flash drive; consulting the IT or other departments to assess whether the hard drive can be restored; and if all else fails; reconstructing Sam's project from scratch.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,scared,sad,stressed,Sam is likely scared because he does not know what the consequences of this will be; sad because of all the work poured into this project and how easily it all got lost; and stressed due to his inability to stop thinking about this misfortune in combination with the realization of potential consequences for being behind on a major piece of work,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0329,329-1,2,2,Bianca,19,19,0,0,1,0,0,0,,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Concerned,Intrigued,Anxious,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Anger,Worry,Distress,,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1329,329-2,1,2,Bianca,21,18,0,0,0,0,1,0,,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,competent ,wanted,betrayed,I feel like i must be wanted Sam for him to email me; and that he would only be doing so if he believed i could help.
