After working as a seasonal 'temp' for a few months; I was asked to come back as a permanent employee. Once I came back; they offered me a higher position with control over organizing daily invoices and arranging prints to be packaged and shipped by the new seasonal employees. I was in charge of assigning and often explaining these orders to the new employees and keeping pristine order of all the prints for that day. It was very nerve-wracking at first; as it was an incredibly fast-paced job and the condition of the prints was always incredibly sensitive. If I made an error it was sort of transferred two-fold to the new employees - as I was now an example of how to do this job. After a few weeks I felt a new confidence in this leadership role; I had never really had one before; but at the same time it was very draining each day to be so aware of how I was influencing the others and how I was effectively keeping control of all of the invoices and prints for the customers. I was hyper aware of the company's relationship with these clients I was controlling the work for; so I was a little hard on the seasonal employees because I knew their mistakes would come back to me. ,,-1,8,86,6,37,72,66,34,77,21,76,24,85,5,56,100,17,58,92,5,94,96,96,0,21,4,78,42,13,47,43,0,26,Female,female,6,5,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,,Good; thank you,None,0,0R_7X7deVgpLWnNzAl,54.174.77.195,0,1,8/13/15 19:20,8/13/15 19:27,0,-1,0,0,,I constantly feel like others have control over me.

I was elected to be the group leader. We delegated tasks in a way that was more than fair to everyone and set up days to meet to talk about how the project was progressing and exchanged contact information. One of the members didn't show up for any group meetings and then plagiarized her entire part of the project. Her excuses were awful; like getting a manicure and meeting up with friends she hadn't seen in a few months. Luckily; I caught the plagiarism before the project was turned in. I talked to the professor and he said he'd make a note of it. Also; we all got to evaluate each other so that the professor could take into account how hard each individual worked. The rest of the group gave the slacking member poor reviews and she ended up doing very poorly. I felt good that I was the group leader in this case because I was able to take charge and had a strong hand in grading the other group
